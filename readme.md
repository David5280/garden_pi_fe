## Summary

*GardenPi* is a mobile app for plant and gardening lovers who wish they had more control over their plants and gardens.  This repository pairs with the [*GardenPi* back-end](https://github.com/Mycobee/garden_pi_be) & [*GardenPi* Python](https://github.com/Mycobee/garden_python) to create a complete application and connect the user to their garden in situations where it was previously impossible.  *GardenPi* allows a user to monitor their beloved plants soil moisture by most recent recording, last five recordings, and average recording over the course of a week... It also allows the user to water their garden remotely, take photos via their phone, and view pictures of their garden taken from the Raspberry Pi.  Additionally, it displays weather data based on their garden location so the user is made aware of current and upcoming conditions.   

### Learning Goals 

1.  Build a fully functional and fully tested React-Native application.
2.  Use an agile process to work with a back end team 
3.  Get experience with back end languages such as Python and Ruby on Rails.
4.  Work with hardware and connect it to the back end data base
5.  Practice an advanced, professional git workflow
6.  Gain more experience using TravisCI
